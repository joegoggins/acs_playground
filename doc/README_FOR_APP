Message to Matt and Pete, bout intent on this:

Ideally, I'd like to build a well tested plugin that provides a nice mechanism for others to contribute:
* Db specific implementations
* Front end clients
* Search "secret sauce" modules for each db specific implementation (these methods would be the magic that pre-processes :q and constructs sql)

A few ideas I'd like to tinker with here and assess feasibility of:
* Clustered auto-completion: Conduct a search accross N models and serve the top X most relevant results for each model.
* Caching strategies: Vanilla action caching, memcached, others?
* Integrate with my weighted_search plugin (haven't open sourced yet)
* Integration with multiple ORM tools, ActiveRecord, DataMapper, etc
* Eventual actual release with Rails 3

If you wanna talk shop 'bout this, let's get together for lunch (Pete), or holla 612 978 8991 (Matt) i think this project will be fun.

I'm beginning the process of integrating Sanction UI and my forked Sanction into an app this week
It's definitely stable, but the finishing touches will come after integrating it in a couple apps, I'll let you know when their is a release.
Also, at some point, it'd be nice to merge our sanction's together, I forked just so I could get nuts in development, my intent is not to keep my fork around, I'd rather contribute to your repo.

Cool.
