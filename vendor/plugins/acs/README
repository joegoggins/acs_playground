Acs: Autocompleter Server
===

This is a flexible API for implementing autocompleter backends with-in a Rails app, it provides a concise way of exposing actions in your appication that yield specific JSON formats for autocompleter client's to digest.  

A POST request like:
  dogs/acc_jquery_basic.json?q=golden
(by default) result in returned JSON like:
  [{name:"golden retriever", species:"goldy species"},
   {name:"golden donky", species:"goldy donky species"},
   ...
   ...
  ]

If clustering is enabled:
  dogs/acc_jquery_clustered.json?q=golden
would result in:
[{"Dog":{matches: 28, average_score: 90,
  results:[
    {name:"golden retriever", species:"goldy species"},
    {name:"golden donky", species:"goldy donky species"},
    ...
    ...
  ]}
 },
 {"Thing":{matches: 19, average_score: 52,
  results:[
    {name:"garden hoe"},
    {name:"golden donky"},
    ...
    ...
  ]}
 },
 ...for each "clustered" data class
]
