Acs: Autocompleter Server
===

This is a flexible API for implementing autocompleter backends with-in a Rails app, it provides a concise way of exposing actions in your appication that yield specific JSON formats for autocompleter client's to digest.  

EXAMPLE:

POST dogs/jquery_basic/golden
=>
  [{name:"golden retriever", species:"goldy species"},
   {name:"golden donky", species:"goldy donky species"},
   ...
  ]

POST /dogs/jquery_clustered/golden
=>
[{"Dog":{matches: 28, average_score: 90,
  results:[
    {name:"golden retriever", species:"goldy species"},
    {name:"golden donky", species:"goldy donky species"},
    ...
  ]}
 },
 {"Thing":{matches: 19, average_score: 52,
  results:[
    {name:"garden hoe"},
    {name:"golden donky"},
    ...
  ]}
 },
 ...for each "clustered" data class...
]

If switched on, json format can reveal the primary key's of the underlying tables, to
allow 1-1 look-up's later with an auto-completer
* results:[
  {name:"golden retreiver", acs_pk:true}
]
CONCEPTS:
One exposes_acs_api line in routes.rb equates to:
* an action being dynamically generated in a controller somewhere

TYPES OF OUTPUT DATA:
* Flat List: A regular old json array of objects
* Flat List with Tags: By posting additional params like
  bla?acs_tag_age_above=25, which will augment each item with json like:
    acs_tags:["age_above_25"], tags will be added by passing each item to model instance method
    called: acs_tag_age_above(n), and it will inspect itself and return true if it has (say for example)
    an age column greater than 25.
* Filtered Flat List, URL like:
  bla?acs_where_age_above=25: 
    When constructing the database query for the full-text search on "bla"
    it adds "AND age > 25" to the SQL.  



Tagging and filtering options will need to be exposed in the API by doing something like:
exposes_acs_api ..., :tag_methods => {:age_above, # looks for a method on model
:age_below => lambda {|val| age < val},
:filter_methods => {...NOT SURE HOW THIS WILL WORK...named_scope references???}

}

* Clustered List: exposes_acs_api expects a :models option that specifies N models that all
  implement_acs_api, yields more complex JSON structure.


API controller params:
  :q  	Query, what the user typed                               
 OR
  :ids  Primary Keys
		ids=Thing|123,Dog|898433-332,Person|994 (clustered style)
		OR
		ids=431,884,332,553
  :n  	Number (max) of results                                  
  :f  	Filter, constrain the DB query further in addition to :q,
      	f=age_above_25,name_begins_with_Ronda%20Nelson           
  :t  	Tag, those matching:                                     
      	t=age_above_15,age_below_40
